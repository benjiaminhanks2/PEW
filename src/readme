This file contains notes about the PEW v1.2 that were too late for 
inclusion in the User Manual.
===================================================================

The ANALYZE menu has a potential problem which may reveal itself when
the demo is run. This problem has been tracked down to Turbo C's
floating point emulation library, and is not a bug in the PEW
itself. It manifests itself as occasional DIVIDE ERROR aborts, or
just plain system lockups. Running the PEW on a system with a math
coprocessor installed will eliminate this unreliability. For those
who do not have a coprocessor, all I can suggest is try your example,
and if it doesn't work, don't use dependent expressions. Rather let the
PEW tabulate the fire counts of the relevant transitions, and then work
out the expressions themselves.

A compiler directive, $F{+|-} has been added, for `fast writes'. After
processing a $F+ directive, all WRITEs and WRITELNs up to the next $F-
or the end of the program, are fast writes. A fast write does not pop
the I/O window up for the 1 second period that usually occurs. The user
will have to explicitly call up the window with F7, unless a READ occurs.
